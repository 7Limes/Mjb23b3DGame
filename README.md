## The "Something Extraâ„¢"

The main things I added were the water splash effects and a death box that teleports the player back onto the level if they fall off. Both of these were useful for learning how to trigger events when a player enters a certain area, which is a pretty common thing in games.

I also added a bit of fog which made distant objects look more interesting.
